# CS683 Project  - WeFriend
WeFriend is an App for students in college who want to make friends whoâ€™s studying in the same college. Because of the outbreak of the cov-19, most schools are holding online courses. It will be hard to make new friends in the new semester. WeFriend will help the user to find someone who study in the same college/major/class. Then the user can send a request to that person, and if that person accept the request, they can start chatting. The potential customer is college students who want to make friends in the new semester.
